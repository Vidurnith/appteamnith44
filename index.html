                               App Team NITH is one of the main technical teams of our college, NIT Hamirpur. We work all year round and organize many technical events at various levels. As the name of our team suggests, our work primarily involves mobile application development, but we do much more than that. We organize hackathons, workshops and promote a coding culture of NITH in general. Yearly, we develop an app during Hillâ€™ffair as well as Nimbus which is the official app for the fest. We also organize workshops on various interesting topics which also include Android App development, Hybrid Apps, Github, Node.js etc. It spreads awareness amidst the students introducing students to many open source concepts. All our projects are open source and anyone within or outside the team can contribute to them. They are readily available on Github for anyone to work on. During the technical festival Nimbus, an inter-college hackathon, Hack on Hills is organized by App Team NITH, it is one of the biggest technical events of our college involving the participation of teams from various colleges. In its first iteration, more than 150 students participated and developed various innovative projects. We would like to welcome anyone who wishes to learn and contribute to the team.
