        ABOUT APP TEAM NITH
    </h1>
    <h3>
        Began as a small group of passionate individuals united by a vision to build something impactful. What started in a modest setting quickly evolved through shared drive, creativity, and relentless effort. Along the way, its members took on challenges that tested and strengthened their bond-most notably organizing HACKONHILLS, the biggest hackathon in North India. Countless late nights, problem-solving sessions, and team wins shaped their path. Today, they stand as a tightly knit team that thrives on innovation, collaboration, and creating meaningful experiences together.
